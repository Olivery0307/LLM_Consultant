# AI Business Consultant

## üìñ About The Project

This project is an advanced, AI-powered business consultant designed to demonstrate a full MLOps lifecycle, from initial concept to a deployed, production-ready system. The application functions as an intelligent agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex business analysis tasks. It can conduct live web research, analyze user-provided documents (`.pdf`, `.txt`, `.csv`), perform quantitative calculations, and generate professional data visualizations.

This repository showcases skills in:
* **LLM Agent Development:** Building autonomous agents with LangChain that can reason and use tools.
* **Full-Stack Implementation:** Creating a user-friendly front-end with Streamlit and a robust Python back-end.
* **ML System Design:** Architecting a system that is scalable, reliable, and ready for advanced MLOps practices like caching, monitoring, and automated evaluation.
* **Advanced Prompt Engineering:** Crafting sophisticated prompts to control LLM output for structured, high-quality analysis.

## ‚ú® Features

The application is organized into several modes, each providing a unique analytical capability:

#### 1. General Web Consultant
* Accepts any open-ended business question.
* Performs live web research using the Tavily Search API.
* Synthesizes the findings into a structured report, including an **Executive Summary**, **Key Findings**, and a **Concluding Insight**.

#### 2. SWOT Analysis
* Generates a comprehensive SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis for any given company.
* Conducts targeted research for each of the four components to produce a detailed and structured report.

#### 3. Document & Data Analysis
* **Analyze Private Documents:** Users can upload `.pdf` and `.txt` files for analysis. The system uses a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline to answer questions based on the document's content.
* **Perform Quantitative Analysis:** Users can upload `.csv` files and ask the agent to perform calculations (e.g., average, sum, count) by writing and executing Python `pandas` code.
* **Automated Data Visualization:** The agent can generate professional, aesthetically pleasing charts and plots using `seaborn` and `matplotlib` to visually answer user questions about CSV data.
